# Emotion_Detection
**Overview:**
This project aims to build an emotion detection model using Machine Learning techniques. The model is designed to classify human emotions from images. By leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and data augmentation, the model can effectively recognize different emotional states.

**Features:**
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing: Efficiently loads and preprocesses image data using OpenCV and Python's glob module.
2. Data Augmentation: Implements real-time data augmentation to enhance the diversity of the training dataset.
3. Model Architecture: Utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras to accurately detect emotions.
4. Training and Validation: Incorporates techniques to monitor training progress and adjust learning rates for optimal performance.
5. Visualization: Provides tools for visualizing the training process and the results of the model.

**To use this project just follow the following steps:**
1. Clone or Download and unzip repository
2. Extract model_weight.h5 file
3. Install tensorflow and cv2 in the system using pip
4. Run gui.py file
5. Upload image in the gui
6. Click on the Detect button to detect the emotion.
